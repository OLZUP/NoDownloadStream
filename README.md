# NoDownloadStream
A way to use python code to watch a video file hosted online without actually downloading it!
Using this code you can stream a video file to your computer without actually downloading the file.
From what I can tell the video stream will create an empty file that your computer won't be able to play.
Just remember to delete the empty file when done watching and poof it's like you never watched anything.
DO NOT use this to watch anything illegal in your country.
